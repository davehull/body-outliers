#
# Like it's older sister, meta-outliers.py, body-outliers.py is a forensics
# tool that analyzes the output of The Sleuth Kit's fls command. Unlike its
# sister, body-outliers.py can only run against an fls bodyfile.
#
# body-outliers.py calculates averages and standard deviations for metadata
# elements on a per directory basis and will find outliers based on the
# arguments provided by the user. The script supports two modes, an "and" mode
# and an "or" mode. In "and" mode, both metadata elements must be outliers in
# order for a file to be included in the output. In "or" mode only one of the
# two elements must be an outlier. As with meta-outliers.py the number of
# standard deviations that makes a file an outlier is configurable via the
# command line.
#
# For usage info:
# ./body-outliers.py -h
#
# To do:
# It's a secret.
